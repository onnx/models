## Inference
Step by step instructions on how to use the pretrained model and link to an example notebook/code. This section should ideally contain:

### Input to model
Input to network (Example: 224x224 pixels in RGB)

### Preprocessing steps
Preprocessing required

### Output of model
Output of network

### Postprocessing steps
Post processing and meaning of output
<hr>

## Dataset (Train and validation)
This section should discuss datasets and any preparation steps if required.
<hr>

## Validation accuracy
Details of experiments leading to accuracy and comparison with the reference paper.
<hr>

## Training
Training details (preprocessing, hyperparameters, resources and environment) along with link to a training notebook (optional)
<hr>

## Validation
Validation script/notebook used to obtain accuracy reported above along with details of how to use it and reproduce accuracy.
