As the machine learning ecosystem has evolved, much of the novel model sharing has successfully transitioned to Hugging Face, which maintains a vibrant and healthy state. We are preserving the ONNX Model Zoo  repository for historical purposes only. Please note that models will no longer be available for LFS download starting July 1st, 2025. You can still get access to the models that were originally available on this repository by going to https://huggingface.co/onnxmodelzoo (available soon).

# ONNX Model Zoo


## Introduction

Welcome to the ONNX Model Zoo! The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open standard format created to represent machine learning models. Supported by a robust community of partners, ONNX defines a common set of operators and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers.

This repository is a curated collection of pre-trained, state-of-the-art models in the ONNX format. These models are sourced from prominent open-source repositories and have been contributed by a diverse group of community members. Our aim is to facilitate the spread and usage of machine learning models among a wider audience of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts.

To handle ONNX model files, which can be large, we use Git LFS (Large File Storage). 

## Models

Currently, we are expanding the ONNX Model Zoo by incorporating additional models from the following categories.
As we are rigorously validating the new models for accuracy, refer to the [validated models](#validated-models) below that have been successfully validated for accuracy:

- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Generative AI
- Graph Machine Learning

These models are sourced from prominent open-source repositories such as [timm](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models), [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision), [torch_hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/), and [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), and exported into the ONNX format using the open-source [TurnkeyML toolchain](https://github.com/onnx/turnkeyml).

Read the [Usage](#usage-) section below for more details on the file formats in the ONNX Model Zoo (.onnx, .pb, .npz), downloading multiple ONNX models through [Git LFS command line](#gitlfs-), and starter Python code for validating your ONNX model using test data.

INT8 models are generated by [Intel® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor). [Intel® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) is an open-source Python library which supports automatic accuracy-driven tuning strategies to help user quickly find out the best quantized model. It implements dynamic and static quantization for ONNX models and can represent quantized ONNX models with operator oriented as well as tensor oriented (QDQ) ways. Users can use web-based UI service or python code to do quantization. Read the [Introduction](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

## Usage <a name="usage-"/>

Every ONNX backend should support running the models out of the box. After downloading and extracting the tarball of each model, you will find:

- A protobuf file `model.onnx` that represents the serialized ONNX model.
- Test data (in the form of serialized protobuf TensorProto files or serialized NumPy archives).

### Usage - Test data starter code

The test data files can be used to validate ONNX models from the Model Zoo. We have provided the following interface examples for you to get started. Please replace `onnx_backend` in your code with the appropriate framework of your choice that provides ONNX inferencing support, and likewise replace `backend.run_model` with the framework's model evaluation logic.

There are two different formats for the test data files:

- Serialized protobuf TensorProtos (.pb), stored in folders with the naming convention `test_data_set_*`.

```python
import numpy as np
import onnx
import os
import glob
import onnx_backend as backend

from onnx import numpy_helper

model = onnx.load('model.onnx')
test_data_dir = 'test_data_set_0'

- Serialized Numpy archives, stored in files with the naming convention `test_data_*.npz`. Each file contains one set of test inputs and outputs.

```python
import numpy as np
import onnx
import onnx_backend as backend

# Load the model and sample inputs and outputs
model = onnx.load(model_pb_path)
sample = np.load(npz_path, encoding='bytes')
inputs = list(sample['inputs'])
outputs = list(sample['outputs'])

# Run the model with an onnx backend and verify the results
np.testing.assert_almost_equal(outputs, backend.run_model(model, inputs))
```

### Usage - Model quantization
You can get quantized ONNX models by using [Intel® Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor). It provides web-based UI service to make quantization easier and supports code-based usage for more abundant quantization settings. Refer to [bench document](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor/blob/master/docs/bench.md) for how to use web-based UI service and [example document](./resource/docs/INC_code.md) for a simple code-based demo.

## Usage

There are multiple ways to access the ONNX Model Zoo:

### Git Clone (Not Recommended)

Cloning the repository using git won't automatically download the ONNX models due to their size. To manage these files, first, install Git LFS by running:

```bash
pip install git-lfs
```

To download a specific model:

```bash
git lfs pull --include="[path to model].onnx" --exclude=""
```

To download all models:

```bash
git lfs pull --include="*" --exclude=""
```

### GitHub UI

Alternatively, you can download models directly from GitHub. Navigate to the model's page and click the "Download" button on the top right corner.

## Model Visualization

For a graphical representation of each model's architecture, we recommend using [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron).
